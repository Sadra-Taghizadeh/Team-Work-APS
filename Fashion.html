        As you can see in the pictures above, in spring and summer time people
        mostly choose more bright and colorful clothes. Another thing that is so
        improtant in summer clothes in the material of the fabric that is used,
        we suggest you more cotton based fabrics such as linen which is great
        for summer but the only problem with linen is that it wrinkle so easily.
        In my opinion don't take it so hard on yourself and enjoy a beautiful
        piece of linen clothing in this hot summer because there is no better
        fabric than linen for summer.

        As you can see in the pictures above in fall/winter dark and warm colors
        are more used by people, people wear more black and grey for these
        colder colors. There are many people who prefer drifferet colors because
        they get bored or even they might feel depressed with dark cloros. It is
        obvius that the colder the weather gets the fabric of the clothes that
        we use gets thicker. There are some pieces that we suggest you for
        fall/winter like trench coats in our opinion trech coats are a great
        piece of clothing for cold seasons they never go out of style. Another
        piece that we suggest is a leather coat; a leather coat is always a good
        idea they are always trendy.
